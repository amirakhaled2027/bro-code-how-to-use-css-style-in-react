How to style a react component in css
-------------------------
(not including external frameworks or preprocessors)

1. EXTERNAL  (EX: pure-css.css) 

2. MODULES (paragraph.modules.css)
   (dedicated css stylesheet, specifically for each component jsx and its style in a folder)

3. INLINE 
   (write your styles using the className in the jsx file itself)
   (don't depend on this method)
